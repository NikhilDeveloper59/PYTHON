# A set is a collection that stores unique elements (no duplicates) and it is unordered.

#  Key Properties

#  No duplicate values
#  Unordered (no indexing)
#  Mutable (can add/remove items)
#  Supports fast membership checking (in)
#  Mostly used for removing duplicates, set operations
# set can't store list but it can store tuple

# s = {10, 20, 30, 40}
# s[0]  --> Error ,not support indexing



# frozenset (immutable)
# Like a set, it stores unique elements
# But cannot be modified after creation (read-only)

# frozenset is useful : Because it is hashable
